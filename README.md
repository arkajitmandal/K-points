# K-points
Its a code to generate K points for YAEHMOP
For now only for 2D Lattice. But can easily be extended to 3D (just an additional for loop .. too lazy to do that :/)
Input : tell the reciprocal vectors v1 and v2 
Recipe to obtain reciprocal vectors v1 and v2 from lattice vectors in real space: Go to http://calistry.org/viz/direct-and-reciprocal-lattice-visualizer and obtain them by taking the 3rd vector as [0 0 1] while the other 2 vectors are [x1 y1 0] and [x2 y2 0] ..... basically your original vectors were [x1 y1] and  [x2 y2] which you wrote as [x1 y1 0] and [x2 y2 0]  
Thats it!
